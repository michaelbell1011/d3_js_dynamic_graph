                            While it might be conceivable that more healthy states -- resulting in an older population -- would also have lower rates of obesity; 
                            there is no clear relationship between US State population's median and and obesity rate.
                            This finding may contradict the assumption that older and more healthy people cluster in specific states, 
                            but are spread out more evenly across the nation.

                        <h6>Obesity as a function of Income</h6>
                        <p>
                            There is distinct negative relationship between Income and Obesity Rates. 
                            The data show US States with more wealthy residents also have lower rates of obesity.
                            A simple conclusion for this observation is that wealthier people have more resources to better maintain their health than do poorer people. 
                            This observation may also be indicitive of how many (or few) public health resources are available via the state governments.
